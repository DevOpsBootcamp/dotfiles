1. Make sure the vagrant virtual machine is shutdown.  E.g., in
   the devopsbootcamp-vagrant folder type 'vagrant halt'.
2. In your linux host, the start up the VirtualBox GUI.
3. In the GUI select the devopsbootcamp-vagrant_default
   virtual machine.
4. In the VirtualBox toolbar click Start.  The devopsbootcamp
   virtual machine will start up in a new window. Select this 
   window.
5. In the VirtualBox top menu, select Devices->CD/DVD Devices
   ->Choose a virtual CD/DVD disk file...
6. Navigage to the VirtualBox application folder in your host
   file system.  For Ubuntu users this will normally be located
   at /usr/share/virtualbox.
7. Select the file VBoxGuestAdditions.iso.
8. Click Open.
9. In the devopsbootcamp virtual machine window, login as vagrant.
10. In the virtual machine window, run
       sudo yum update
11. Then run
       sudo yum install kernel-devel
12. Reboot by typing
       sudo halt -p
13. Repeat step 4 and login in again as vagrant.
11. Type the following command
        sudo mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /media
    The device will be mounted read-only - this is ok.
12. Type the command
        cd /media
    Type 'ls' to see the contents of the iso image you
    just mounted.
13. Type the following command
        sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
    The install will fail for Microsoft Windows specific
    guest additions.  Since devopsbootcamp is a Linux
    virtual machine, this is not an issue.
14. Shutdown the devopbootcamp virtual machine by typing
        halt -p
15. Test everything by going to your vagrant folder and
    starting up using vagrant, e.g., vagrant up.  The
    guest additions warnings should not appear.
